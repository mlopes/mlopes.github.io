On the 22nd of March I'll be speaking about DDD and Modeling by Example at the
Code Mastery meetup. The code mastery meetup will be taking place in Old
Street, at the Stack Overflow's offices.

If you're interested in DDD, and want to hear more about how you can use
gerkhin as a framework to help you drive your domain, then this is a talk for
you.
