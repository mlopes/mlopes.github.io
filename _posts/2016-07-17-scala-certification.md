I've just completed the newly created Scala Certification. Lightbend, formerly known as Typesafe, has created a Scala certification schema via Coursera.
By completing the required Coursera course, taught by Martin Odersky, the creator of Scala, I have just become a certified Scala developer. I'm looking forward to give some use to those newly acquired skills.
