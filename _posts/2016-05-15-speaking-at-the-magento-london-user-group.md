Later this month of May I'll be speaking at the London Magento User Group meetup. This meetup will be at Inviqa's London office shortly after 6pm, on the 25th of May.  I'll be presenting my "Driving your domain by examples" talk, which I've presented earlier this year at the Developers Paradise, in Opatija, Croatia. This talk, focus on using Gherkin examples to drive the design of your application, and help you model your code after the domain of the problem.
