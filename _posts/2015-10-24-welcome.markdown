Hello, this is my page. Here you can find some generic information about me and what I've been doing.

This is meant to work more like a personal page rather than a blog, so don't expect frequent blog updates. This doesn't mean I will never update the blog, but I won't be doing it a lot.

For somewhat more frequent updates on my generic technical posts, check [my tech blog][marco-lopes_com]. If you're interested in my game development posts, then be sure to check [The Lemon Behind The Sofa][lemon_behind_the_sofa], which is where I post news and updates about the games I'm developing, along with technical information regarding the development process.
Unfortunately those are not updated that frequently either, as I prefer to spend my free time actually making games rather than writing about them, but sometimes I like to give an update on what's going on.

Hope you like my page. Don't hesitate to contact me if you feel you have something to say.
